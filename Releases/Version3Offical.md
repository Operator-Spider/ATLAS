# Version 3.0 — Official Public Release 🎉

## TL;DR 📋
After over a year of careful development, ATLAS Development proudly announces Version 3 of our product hub. V3 refines the seller–buyer workflow, improves delivery and security, and provides a faster, more reliable web experience for customers and internal teams. This official public release is polished, stable, and ready for broader use.

## Highlights ✨
- Redesigned user dashboard — clearer product management and quick purchase/delivery history access.
- Improved product delivery pipeline — faster, more reliable item delivery with better retries and observability.
- Stronger security posture — product keys are stored and validated in hardened services; whitelisting and access control were tightened.
- Full API and audit logging for staff — easier troubleshooting and safer internal operations without exposing sensitive data publicly.
- Performance and uptime improvements — edge routing and caching optimizations to reduce latency and handle higher traffic.
- Better metrics and monitoring — visibility into usage, delivery success rates, and service health for proactive maintenance.


## Release notes (short) ⚙️
- Overhauled web interface with expanded logs and safer internal tooling.
- A new user dashboard for product management and history is needed.
- Improved delivery reliability and performance.
- Security hardening around key storage and whitelisting.


## Full Release Notes 🛠️
Delivery and reliability: Delivery components were refactored for resilience. Retry paths and timeouts were tightened to reduce failed deliveries. Observability was added so staff could quickly see and diagnose delivery issues.

Security and keys: We moved away from relying solely on third-party game platform storage for production keys. Keys are stored and validated in controlled backend services with hashing and limited access. Authentication and whitelisting flows were hardened to reduce abuse while preserving legitimate use cases.

- Privacy & telemetry: Usage metrics were consolidated to stable analytics systems to help us prioritize product improvements. Telemetry focuses on operational health and anonymized usage patterns; no private user data is exposed in public dashboards.

- Infrastructure: Edge routing and caching (via a CDN) are used to lower latency and smooth traffic spikes. Backend services were tuned for faster response times and better error visibility.

## What changed for users & developers ✅
- Users: cleaner dashboard, faster delivery, and clearer support channels.
- Sellers: improved product management UI and safer key-handling tools.
- Developers / Staff: richer API logs, better debugging views, and safer internal tools for investigating issues without leaking customer data.

## Known limitations & roadmap 🛣️
- Payment storefronts (real-currency purchases) are planned but not live.
- Ongoing improvements: additional automation for fraud detection, expanded analytics, and more developer-facing tooling.
