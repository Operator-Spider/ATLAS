# Version 3.0 Official Public Release :confetti_ball: 

## Summary :clipboard: 
After over a year of development @xvoid. and I are exited to announce the official launch of the ATLAS product hub! We have worked hard to bridge the gap between seller and buyer by making the system as usable as possible for all skill levels ranging from beginner to seasoned scripter. This system is one of the most advanced systems out there with state of the art custom product delivery, incredibly secure product whitelisting and lightning fast servers routed through Cloudflare!

This system has aimed to deviate away from using roblox systems as much as possible for things like storing product keys, which are now stored as hash in an AWS Cloud server, or usage metrics which has been now shifted to Google Analytics. We at ATLAS development have made many more changes JUST like this to make the experience as fast and secure as possible. Our [website](https://atlas-development-services.operator-spider.com/) now also has advanced metrics on whenever any of our servies, or services we use go down. (The online store has not been  added but will be coming in the future to view products online and eventually purchase with actual currency)
