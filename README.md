## Summary :clipboard: 
After over a year of development, ATLAS Development Management is excited to announce the official launch of the ATLAS product hub Version 3.0! We have worked hard to bridge the gap between seller and buyer by making the system and its products as usable as possible for all skill levels, from beginner to seasoned scripter. This system is one of the most advanced out there, with state-of-the-art custom product delivery, incredibly secure product whitelisting, and lightning-fast servers routed through Cloudflare!

This system has aimed to deviate from using Roblox systems as much as possible for things like storing product keys, which are now stored as a hash in an AWS Cloud server, or usage metrics, which have now been shifted to Google Analytics. At ATLAS development, we have made many more changes just like this to make the experience as fast and secure as possible. Our [website](https://atlas-development-services.operator-spider.com/) now also has advanced metrics on whenever any of our services, or services we use, go down. (The online store has 
not been  added, but will be coming in the future to view products online and eventually purchase with actual currency.

Since our last Alpha version, some of you might have noticed a rebranding and updates to our bot systems. We have done this to reflect the shift from a system in Alpha to the first official public version. We have done MAJOR rebranding and hope to show you all we offer!
